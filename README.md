# Python-Curses-Console-UI
A small script that contains several custom "components", made with help of curses library.
I didn't plan to upload this initially, but since I couldn't find exact existing solution, maybe someone else will need something similar.

# Plans:
- Add components
- [X] fields
- [X] Check box
- [ ] Select menu (dropdown)
- [ ] Buttons
- At least have tests and module in distinct files
